# **Fretboard Visualizer**

With this application you can visualize the Major, Minor and Harmonic Major and Minor scales, as well as
their modes and more exotic scales like the 'Iwato Scale' in any key and all over the fretboard. The "Arpeggio
Visualizer" section works identically but visualizes all common and some exotic arpeggios,
i.e. Major, Minor, Major and Minor 7th, Diminished 7th, 'Minor/Major 9' etc.

### Instructions:

Hit the "Toggle Advanced Options" button to choose a 7-string or 8-string guitar fretboard, detune the
guitar up to 8 semitones, and use drop-tuning if required.

Drag the yellow box around to highlight convenient "box" shapes, or hit the checkbox to hide it.
You can also click on highlighted notes (hide the fretboard box first) to remove the highlight,
which can be used to create custom patterns, such as three note per string shapes etc.

Hit the "Save As Image" button to save your custom patterns to a png file, which you can view on
your device at any time. This saves you recreating a pattern each time you want to use it.

Example usage: select the C Major Scale, and run through the C Major 7, D minor 7, E minor 7,
F Major 7, G Dominant 7, A minor 7 and B Half Diminished 7 arpeggios, and see that all of the
notes in each arpeggio are contained in the C Major/Ionian Scale.

This is Diatonic Harmony, and tells you which chords you can safely use
together (there are others, but that is more advanced). Play around and learn!
